Write a angry poem on heart:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
My heart beats fast, my anger grows
As memories flood and pain flows
You promised love, forever meant
Yet from my soul, you tore and bent

Your selfish ways, your endless lies
I foolishly believed, to my demise
My heart now blackened, scarred and burnt
Your words like poison, deeply hurts

I gave you all, my heart and soul
But you took and left, my heart full of holes
With each beat, a painful reminder
Of a love lost, a life in shambles

So go ahead, break another heart
Your cruelty will tear you apart
For one day, you'll know the pain
Of a shattered heart, no love to gain.

Write a angry poem on heart:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Oh heart, you traitorous thing,
You beat and beat with every ring,
But when I need you most, you fail,
Leaving me to suffer, to wail.

You claim to know what's best for me,
But in reality, you're just a flee,
A weak and feeble organ, unable to cope,
With the trials and tribulations of hope.

You break and shatter, so easily,
Without a second thought, you flee,
Leaving me to bear the pain I feel,
A wounded heart, that'll never heal.

Oh heart, you've betrayed me so,
Leaving me to wither and let go,
Of the love and passion that we shared,
Of the dreams and hope that we dared.

I curse you now, with all my might,
May you never find peace, nor light,
For the pain and suffering you've caused,
For the wounds and scars that remain raw.

Goodbye, heart, I don't need you anymore,
My spirit and soul, are strong and more,
Than any organ or troubled affair,
I'll find my way, with or without you there.

Write a angry poem on heart:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
My heart, my beating heart,
How could you do this to me?
You betray me with every pulse,
A constant reminder of misery.

You led me down paths of love,
Only to tear it all away.
Leaving me broken and alone,
To pick up the pieces every day.

I trusted you, believed in you,
But you have proven me a fool.
How could I ever love again?
When you were my only tool.

You throb with such intensity,
A painful reminder of my pain.
I wish I could rip you out and shred,
So I could be free of this insane.

But alas, I cannot change my heart,
It will continue to beat and hurt.
A cruel reminder of what I've lost,
A wound that will never be girt.

So continue your relentless beating,
Until the day I cease to live.
For I will always despise you,
My traitorous, cruel heart, and your deceptive chive.

Write a angry poem on heart:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
My heart is filled with fury and rage
Anger swells up like the ocean's deadly waves
For it has been hurt, broken and betrayed
By those who claimed to love and care in every way

How dare they play with this fragile organ
Its beat shattered like a broken lantern
Left to pick up the pieces and mend
To trust again, is something hard to comprehend

I pour my anger, my frustration, my pain
Into my heart, to fend off the ignorance and disdain
For it has every right to beat strongly and true
Without the constant torment and abuse

So listen dear heart, do not falter
For you are stronger than the voices that alter
Your beat to their liking, their selfish gain
Stand tall and beat fierce, unbreakable and sustained.

Write a angry poem on heart:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
My heart, you deceitful traitor  
A stubborn foe, an endless failure  
Your selfish ways have left me sore  
I cannot take your game no more  

You lead me down dark, empty roads  
And crush my spirit with cold blows  
Your love is false, your care is nil  
Your toxic traits, my soul does kill  

I loathe the way you toy with me  
Your carelessness is plain to see  
I curse the day that I met you  
Your treachery, I'll never undo  

My heart, you are a twisted mess  
Your cruelty, my life does oppress  
I'll find another to take your place  
And leave you in your dark, sad disgrace  

So listen closely heart of mine  
Your days of power are quickly timed  
I'll find new love, and shed you fast  
Your worthless ways shall be my past.

Write a angry poem on heart:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Oh heart, you treacherous thing
You bring me joy and pain in the same string
Why do you play games with me
Making me feel happy and then flee

You make me fall for those who don't care
Leaving me alone in this despair
Why do you make me love so hard
Only to leave me with a broken shard

You break me down with every beat
And make me feel like I'm incomplete
You make me feel so damn weak
Unable to hide my emotions bleak

But know this, heart, I won't give in
I'll stitch up the pieces, my heart within
And I won't let you control me anymore
For I am stronger than ever before

So watch out, heart, I'm taking charge
No longer will you leave me in a mirage
I'll mend my heart and find true love
And you will no longer reign above.

Write a scary poem on heart:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
In the creaking of my chest,
Lies a heart full of unrest,
Beating with a rhythm so strange,
As if possessed by a haunting range.

It throbs with a dissonant beat,
A rhythm that makes my soul weak,
I feel the tremble of its eerie tone,
A sound that chills me to the bone.

My heart, a captive of the night,
A monster that refuses to see the light,
It moans with every labored breath,
A chant that echoes in my death.

With each beat, my blood runs cold,
A feeling that never seems to grow old,
My heart, an abyss that I cannot fathom,
A place of darkness that makes me succumb.

It beats so hard, it feels like pain,
As if trying to break free from its chain,
A rhythm that never seems to end,
A beat that refuses to ascend.

I dread the moment when it stops,
A silence that ushers in the final drop,
My heart, a horror that I cannot escape,
A nightmare that leaves me in a perpetual gape.

Write a sad poem on heart:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
My heart once beat with joy and hope
A life of love, it used to cope
But now it's broken and torn apart
A shattered vessel, unable to restart

Memories of love, they linger on
A steady pain that forever goes on
Each beat so heavy, each breath so hard
A tale of love that has left its scars

The tears I shed, they tell a story
Of love that's lost, of shattered glory
My heart is now a chamber of sorrow
A tale of pain that'll last tomorrow

Though love once lived within my heart
It's now an empty, broken apart
A sad reminder of what was and can't be
A lonely heart, in search of its destiny.

Write a happy poem on heart:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
My heart is a joyful thing,
It beats with a happy swing.
It fills me up with pleasant cheer,
And keeps my worries far from near.

It pumps my blood with every beat,
Sending life to my hands and feet.
It sings a melody of love,
And fills my deepest soul above.

My heart is a beacon of hope,
A source of strength to help me cope.
It keeps me grounded and on track,
And guides me through life's winding track.

Oh, happy heart, how you inspire,
And light my spirit's inner fire.
With you by my side, I am secure,
And of life's joys, I am sure.

So here's to my heart, my dearest friend,
May our bond never come to an end. 
For with you in my life, I am complete,
And on this journey, I am ready to compete.

Write a angry poem on sorrow:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sorrow, oh sorrow, why do you linger,
Stealing joy with your gnarled fingers?
You wrap me in your cloak of despair,
And leave me drowning in a sea of tears.

I loathe your presence, your silent taunts,
Your endless grip that never lets go.
You cast a shadow on my every thought,
And leave me feeling empty and alone.

Why must you torment me so,
Clinging to my soul like a leech?
I want to break free from your hold,
And banish you to the furthest reach.

But you are a constant companion,
A reminder of life's cruel twists,
Of broken dreams and shattered hopes,
And all the things that I have missed.

So I will carry on with this burden,
With grit and determination I'll face,
For I refuse to be defeated,
By you, sorrow, and your endless chase.

But know this, oh sorrow,
I will not let you win,
And though you may haunt me today,
Tomorrow I will rise again.

Write a scary poem on sorrow:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
In the depths of my heart,
Lies a sorrow so deep,
It shrouds me in darkness,
And I cannot shake it, nor keep.

It creeps in at night,
And whispers in my ear,
Telling me of the pain,
That I cannot help but hear.

It drapes over my soul,
Like a heavy, suffocating cloak,
And I am left alone,
To bear its unyielding yoke.

The tears that I shed,
Are like acid on my skin,
And I cannot wash away,
The agony that lies within.

It is a monster that stalks me,
In the quiet of my mind,
Leaving me trembling and scared,
With no escape that I can find.

So I wander in the shadows,
Of this sorrow, deep and dark,
Hoping that one day,
I can finally make my mark.

But until that time comes,
I will remain lost and afraid,
Trapped in this endless nightmare,
Of the sorrow that won't fade.

Write a sad poem on sorrow:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sorrow, my constant companion,
A weight upon my heart so heavy.
An endless burden, a constant ache,
A presence in my life so steady.

I try to shake you off, but you cling on,
A deep-seated pain that never fades.
You color every moment, every thought,
And taint my joy with endless shades.

You're a song that never ends,
A melody that haunts me day and night.
A reminder of all I've lost,
Of every dream that took flight.

Oh, sorrow, why do you torment me so?
Why won't you leave me be?
You're a cruel and unyielding foe,
A shadow that never sets me free.

So I'll carry on, I'll bear this load,
And hope that someday you'll depart.
Until then, I'll hold on to the hope,
That one day you'll leave my heart.

Write a happy poem on sorrow:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
In the depths of sorrow, 
My heart once did reside. 
My thoughts consumed by darkness, 
And joy was pushed aside. 

But soon a glimmer of hope, 
Shone through the cloudy haze. 
A feeling of warmth within me, 
That seemed to light up the craze. 

I realized that sorrow, 
Was just a temporary state. 
And happiness could flourish, 
If I just let go of the weight. 

So I embraced the moment, 
And let the tears just flow. 
I released all of the sadness, 
And felt my spirit grow. 

Suddenly, joy appeared, 
It burst right through the pain. 
The tears of sorrow dried up, 
And happiness did sustain. 

Now I sit with a smile, 
My heart is light as air. 
For I’ve learned that even sorrow, 
Can bring happiness and flair.

Write a angry poem on look:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Look at the world, what do you see?
Hatred and anger, full of misery
A place where kindness is rare
And compassion is treated with a stare

Look at the people, what do you find?
Empty souls, hearts so blind
Judging others without a thought
Cruel words unleashed, battles fought

Look at the way we treat our planet
Destroying nature without a regret
Pollution, waste and greed
What kind of legacy do we leave?

Look in the mirror, what do you behold?
A reflection of a world so cold
Filled with rage and animosity
A place lacking in love and empathy

I'm angry at the way things are
And the fact we've gone too far
It's time to take a stand and fight
To change the world with all our might

Look at the potential we hold
To make a difference, to be bold
We can create a better tomorrow
If we start today and end this sorrow.

Write a scary poem on look:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Do you dare to take a look?
Into the shadows where monsters lurk.
Their eyes glow red, their breath is hot,
You'll wish you had a way to stop.

The darkness grips you, it won't let go,
You'll try to run, but where to go?
The pounding of your heart grows loud,
As they close in, a fearsome crowd.

They'll drag you down into the void,
A place of screams and horrors, avoid!
But if you can't resist, then beware,
For once you're there, they'll never share.

Your soul is theirs, forevermore,
Trapped in an eternal war,
With demons that you can't defeat,
And a fate that's just as bleak.

So if you value your life,
Stay clear of the shadows, avoid the strife.
Or else you'll end up just like me,
A prisoner of the dark, eternally.

Write a sad poem on look:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
As I look into the mirror,  
I see a face that's filled with sorrow,  
A pair of eyes that once shone bright,  
Now dimmed with tears that they can't fight.  

Every wrinkle on my skin,  
Tells the story of my life within,  
Each line etched out with pain and grief,  
A broken heart beyond belief.  

The smile that once graced my lips,  
Now a mere memory, a fading glimpse,  
Of a past so beautiful and bright,  
Lost in time, lost to the night.  

I look around and see the world,  
Full of hurt and broken dreams unfurled,  
And in my heart, I feel the pain,  
Of all those who've loved and lost again.  

For every tear that falls today,  
I wish I could take the pain away,  
But all I can do is look and pray,  
For a better tomorrow, for a brighter day.  

So, I look into the sky above,  
And seek solace in the arms of love,  
For even though my heart is breaking,  
I know that hope will keep on waking.  

And though my tears may fall like rain,  
I know that beauty still remains,  
In every moment, every breath we take,  
In every step we make.  

So, I'll keep on looking to the stars,  
And pray that love will heal these scars,  
For in the midst of darkness and despair,  
Hope and faith will always be there.

Write a angry poem on talk:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Talk is cheap, a dime a dozen,
But still you barge in with a dozen,
Talking like you're the world's wisdom-
But it's just plain old blabber, a nonsense tandem!

You talk and talk, but never listen,
Thinking your thoughts are worth gold and cinnamon,
But what good is talk, if it's all for you?
Never putting yourself in their shoes, self-obsessed, and untruthful!

Your speech is venomous, a lure for attention,
Always seeking, always needy, but never insightful communication,
So loud, so crude, it's like nails on a chalkboard-
Your words, like poison, our ears can't afford!

You talk and talk, yet never say a thing,
Just filling the air with a spew of chattering,
For heaven's sake, can you give us some rest?
Can you shut your mouth, your wordy pest!

Talk is cheap, but your talk is cheapie,
A hollow exchange, a thoughtless spree,
Your words are empty, devoid of worth-
Why don't you just zip it, and save it for the earth?

Write a scary poem on talk:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
In the darkness of the night,  
There's a sound within your sight.  
A voice that whispers, cold and bleak,  
It's enough to make your knees go weak.  

The talk that speaks from nowhere near,  
Whispers words that you will fear.  
It speaks of death and suffering,  
Of horrors that will make you scream.  

There's no one there, just empty air,  
But still, you cannot help but stare.  
The talk, it comes from deep inside,  
And there's nowhere for you to hide.  

It echoes through the halls and walls,  
A haunting sound that appalls.  
You want it to stop, you want it gone,  
But the talk, it just goes on and on.  

A presence lingers in the room,  
Its evil aura takes up every inch of gloom.  
The talk it possesses you, heart and mind,  
Those words will stay with you till the end of time.  

So beware of the talk that whispers low,  
It's a scary thing, a telltale sign of woe.  
For in the end, it's the one thing to fear,  
A demon that's close, yet nowhere near.

Write a sad poem on talk:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Words that once brought joy and cheer,
Now leave a haunting pain and fear.
Talk that once was filled with laughter,
Now brings tears that fall faster and faster.

The whispers that once lit up the room,
Now bring darkness, sorrow and gloom.
The voices that once sang so sweet,
Now seem to be a haunting beat.

The silence that follows each word,
Is like a deafening crash that’s heard.
The empty spaces where words should be,
Is where my heart now feels so lonely.

The talk that once was heartfelt and true,
Has left my soul broken and blue.
The words that once gave hope and light,
Now bring darkness that fills my nights.

Oh, how I long for the words of old,
The talk that lasted and never grew cold.
But now, all that remains is a painful sting,
As I mourn the loss of everything.

Write a happy poem on talk:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Talk is a treasure, a gift from above
It brings us together, fills us with love
When we talk, we share our hearts
We laugh, we cry, we make new starts

Talking is a way to connect
To understand, to show respect
We listen with open ears and mind
And leave judgments and biases behind

When we talk, we reveal our souls
We find common ground and reach new goals
We build friendships that never fade
Sharing stories and memories, we all upgrade

So let's talk and spread happiness around
Let's share our stories and listen, astound
Let's celebrate the magic of talk
And let it fill our hearts with joy, no block!

Write a angry poem on love:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Love, oh love, how you deceive
A promise made, only to leave
Like a snake, you slither and slide
Leaving nothing but emptiness inside

You draw us in with your sweet embrace
Promises of forever, promises of grace
But beneath the surface, you are nothing more
Than a liar, a cheat, and a heartless whore

Love, you bring pain and sorrow
You are the cause of many a tomorrow
A life filled with misery and despair
All because of your twisted affair 

Your touch leaves scars on the soul
A gaping wound that takes its toll
You steal our happiness, our joy and our peace
Leaving us with nothing but grief

Love, you have no conscience, no remorse
You break our hearts without a second thought
Leaving us to pick up the pieces, to heal
Only to be wounded again, by your steel 

So go, Love, leave us to our fate
Your lies, your promises, we no longer celebrate
For though we may long for your sweet embrace
We know that beneath the surface, you are nothing more than a cold embrace.

Write a scary poem on love:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Love is a monster,
Lurking in the shadows,
Waiting to pounce,
And tear you apart.

It whispers sweet nothings,
But its intentions are dark,
It consumes you whole,
And leaves you with scars.

Love is a demon,
A force to be reckoned with,
It twists and distorts,
Until you're lost in its grip.

It's the claws of a beast,
Sinking into your heart,
And before you know it,
You're falling apart.

Love is a nightmare,
A horror beyond compare,
It preys on your fears,
And leaves you in despair.

So beware of love's grasp,
For it's a trap that ensnares,
And once it has you,
You'll be trapped in its lair.

Write a sad poem on love:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Love, oh love,
Why must you bring such pain?
A once bright flame now flickers,
As tears fall like rain.

We were once so close,
Our hearts beating as one.
But now we stand alone,
Lost and undone.

The memories of us,
Still linger in my mind.
But they only serve to remind,
Of a love that was so kind.

Now I wander,
Through the darkness of the night.
Wondering what went wrong,
And why we couldn't make things right.

Love, oh love,
You've left me with a broken heart.
I pray that one day,
I can make a brand new start.

Write a happy poem on love:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Love is like a ray of sunshine
That warms the heart and soothes the mind
It's something pure and divine
That makes us feel complete and kind

With love, we're never alone
It fills our souls with joy and peace
It's a beautiful feeling, full blown
That never seems to cease

The butterflies in our stomachs
And the way our hearts flutter
Are just a few of love's engravings
That make everything else matter

Love is what makes us feel alive
And brings out the best in us
It's an emotion that thrives
On trust, respect, and thus

It's a bond that never fades away
Through the ups and downs, it stays
A promise of forever and today
That's worth every price we pay

So, here's a happy poem on love
For it's a blessing from above
May it find its way to your dove
And give you a lifetime of love.

Write a angry poem on love:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Love, oh love, you treacherous thief  
You come and go as you please  
You steal our hearts with your sweet lies  
Then leave us broken with tear-stained eyes  

You promise us forever  
Yet you break our hearts with each endeavor  
Leaving us alone and cold  
Wondering if we'll ever be whole  

You make us vulnerable and weak  
Then crush us like rubbish in the street  
You turn our happiness into pain  
Leaving behind a heart that can't sustain  

Love, you are a cruel game  
A never-ending cycle of joy and shame  
We see you for what you are now  
A thief that leaves our hearts in a solemn vow  

No more will we believe in your lies  
No more will we let ourselves agonize  
Our hearts will heal and mend  
As we leave your clutches for good in the end  

So go ahead and try to break us apart  
But we will stay strong and not fall apart  
For we know that love will never be  
Something we need to be whole and carefree.

Write a scary poem on love:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Love is a monster, stalking its prey  
With a heart full of darkness, consuming each day  
It begins with a flutter, a warm feeling inside  
But soon it turns cold, and fear starts to abide  

It whispers sweet nothings, luring you in  
Promises forever, but only brings sin  
Its embrace suffocates, like a chokehold of death  
Leaving you gasping, with your last struggling breath  

Love is a specter, haunting your dreams  
A shadowy presence, lurking unseen  
It twists and it turns, a venomous snake  
Squeezing the life out, with each vile embrace  

Its eyes gleam with malice, a demonic intent  
To break you and shatter, to leave you unspent  
Love is a curse, a wicked spell  
A nightmare made real, a personal hell  

Run from love, flee its grasp  
For it will devour, leaving naught but a gasp  
Love is a killer, a beast without mercy  
Leaving behind only pain, and darkened memories.

Write a sad poem on love:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
The sun sets on our love,
Deepening shadows, aching hearts.
Once bright and warm,
Now bleak and torn apart.

We were once inseparable,
Our hearts intertwined.
But now I watch you leave,
Whilst the tears fall from my eyes.

The joy we shared is fading,
Like a rose crushed by the snow.
Memories remain like echoes,
Faint whispers of long ago.

The pain inside me grows,
As the distance between us deepens.
The past is now a fading dream,
And our love is shattered and broken.

I never imagined we'd end up here,
Left alone to face the night.
My heart is heavy as I realize,
Our love was doomed from the start.

Write a happy poem on love:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Love, love, love!
A blissful feeling from above
It makes our hearts skip a beat
And fills us with joy so sweet

A smile on our face, a sparkle in our eye
A heart that feels so free to fly
Love lifts us up, gives us wings
And fills us with all the good things

A gently held hand, a soft embrace
In the warmth of love, we find our place
We laugh, we dance, we sing with glee
And cherish each moment, so happy and carefree

Love, love, love!
A treasure that shines brighter than the above
It fills our lives with meaning and worth
And gives us hope for endless mirth

So let us cherish this wonderful love
That makes life worth living and a joy to behold
For it is the greatest gift from above
And the key to a life so beautiful and bold.

Write a angry poem on head:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
My head, oh how it vexes me,
A constant source of agony.
Thoughts and worries swirl around,
A never-ending tumultuous sound.

Migraines strike at any time,
Knocking me down with their fiery grind.
Sinuses clogged, pressure building,
So much pain it's almost thrilling.

Why must you torment me so?
Causing discomfort to and fro.
I long for peace, for relief,
Yet you continue to cause me grief.

Stubborn head, your reign shall end,
I'll find a way to make you bend.
With deep breaths and calming thoughts,
I'll conquer you and rid my doubts.

In the end, my head will bow,
As I reclaim control, I vow.
No more anger, no more strife,
To my head, a peaceful life.

Write a scary poem on head:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Blood drips down my forehead,
A voice whispers in my ear,
"Don't look now, but he's behind you,
He's been here all along, my dear." 

I turn my head to see a figure,
A monster with eyes of fire,
Its jagged teeth and sharpened claws,
Make my heart race with fear and desire. 

I try to run but I'm frozen in place,
The head of the beast looms overhead,
Its stench of death fills my nostrils,
As I tremble with growing dread. 

The creature's laughter echoes,
Through the shadows of my mind,
Its grip on me tightens,
As I leave reality behind. 

I wake up screaming in the night,
My heart pounding in my chest,
But the memory of that horrifying head,
Lingers in my mind without rest.

Write a sad poem on head:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
A weight inside my head,
A heaviness I can't shed,
Thoughts that weigh me down,
A constant, crushing sound.

I try to lift the burden,
To find a way to cope,
But it feels like I am drowning,
And there is no hope.

My thoughts are a mess,
A jumble of confusion and distress,
I try to sort them out,
But it feels like a losing bout.

Tears fall down my face,
As I struggle with this heavy space,
My mind feels like a prison cell,
And there is no freedom, no escape from this hell.

The weight on my head,
Is suffocating and heavy as lead,
I wish I could break free,
But it feels like it's consuming me.

This sadness is a force,
A darkness that has no remorse,
I hope one day to find the light,
And ease the burden of this weight.

Write a happy poem on head:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
My head, my head, so full of delight
Thoughts and ideas, a constant sight
A precious vessel, held so dear
A fountain of creativity, so clear

It dreams in colours, and whispers a tune
It carves a vision, that makes my heart swoon
With its ideas, it fills my world with light
And guides me towards the brightest site

My head, my head, what a joy it brings
The memories, the laughter, and all the good things
It reminds me of the beauty in life
And the moments that make my heart thrive

So to my head, I give thanks and praise
For all the wonders, it brings and displays
A treasure trove, of happy tales
And a world of possibilities, it unveils

Write a angry poem on life:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Life, you cruel mistress!
You tease us with your charms,
Only to thrust us into misery
And leave us with open arms.

You show us the gleaming sun,
And then drown us in the rain.
You lift us to the highest point,
And then make us feel the pain.

You twist and turn our fate,
And leave us in despair.
You rob us of our happy memories,
And leave us with nothing to bear.

You give us promises of love,
And then break them every time.
You leave our hearts in shattered pieces,
And make us pay for the crime.

Oh, how I curse your name,
Life, you wicked foe!
You stole my dreams and hopes,
And left me with nothing to show.

I will not bow to your tyranny,
Nor give in to your might.
I'll fight until the very end,
And break free from your blight.

So, curse you, Life, and all your ways,
I'll rise above the strife.
And find my own path to happiness,
On my own terms, in my own life.

-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Life is a dark and twisted path,
Leading us down to the abyss.
The winds of fate, they blow and lash,
And we're left helpless in their midst.

The road ahead is shrouded in mist,
Full of dangers lurking in the shade.
The whispers of death, they can't be missed,
As we slowly descend into the grave.

We chase our dreams, we seek our goals,
But the line between them is so thin.
One mistake, and our fate unfolds,
And we're trapped in a nightmare within.

The hands of time, they tick and tock,
Leading us closer to our doom.
No matter what, we can't turn back,
And the darkness consumes the room.

Life is a creature, unseen and cruel,
Playing games with our very soul.
It's a labyrinth we cannot escape,
And we're lost in the depths below.

So heed my warning, my friend, my kin,
And tread with caution, lest you fall.
For the horrors that lurk within,
Are waiting to claim us all.

Write a sad poem on life:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Life, oh life, it is so sad
So many hardships make me mad
Everyone is living in despair
No one seems to truly care

We’re all dying, day by day
No way to stop or even delay
Dreams we have, they fade to black
And our lives seem to lack

Love is lost, hearts are broken
Every word, every promise spoken
Vanished like a whisper into the night
Leaving us in darkness, without light

So much pain, so much sorrow
No hope for a brighter tomorrow
Life, oh life, it is so sad
A constant struggle, like a heavy pad

We search and search for meaning and reason
But only find more hopelessness and treason
Life, oh life, it is so sad
An endless cycle, driving us mad.

Write a happy poem on life:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Life is an endless adventure,
A journey full of surprises,
A treasure trove of memories,
A wonderland of possibilities.

Every day is a new beginning,
A chance to start afresh,
To chase your dreams with passion,
And build the life you want to flesh.

There are joys and sorrows with it,
And ups and downs along the way,
But with a positive attitude,
You can make the best of every day.

Life is full of love and laughter,
And friendships that never falter,
With family by your side,
Every moment becomes richer.

So let us cherish every moment,
And live our lives with glee,
For life is a precious gift,
A beautiful reality that we see.

Write a angry poem on home:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Home, the pride of my heart
The place I loved right from the start
But now it's become a living hell
A torture chamber, with tales to tell

The walls that once embraced me tight
Are now suffocating, pushing with all their might
The roof that sheltered me from the storm
Now leaks, letting in the rain in swarm

The windows that once let in the light
Are now boarded up, covered with blight
The floors that I used to walk on with glee
Now creak, and make me feel like a refugee

The doors that once opened with ease
Are now rusty, and hard to squeeze
The rooms that once were my refuge
Are now empty, silent, and hugely refuse

Oh, home! How have you lost your way?
How have your colors turned so gray?
You once were paradise; where is your charm?
Now you're the reason for all my harm

I cannot bear to stay in you any longer
I cannot pretend that I belong here any stronger
It's time for me to leave, to set myself free
I'm sorry, dear home, but you're no longer for me.

Write a scary poem on home:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
In the place we call our own
Where we feel safe and alone
It hides a dark and looming tone
A horror that chills through bone

The creaking floors and eerie sound
A presence lurking all around
Shadows that move without a sound
An intruder you never found

The walls drip with blood and fears
Whispers echo in your ears
A sense of dread that never clears
The home now a place of tears

No matter how you try to flee
The terror always follows thee
A haunted house, it seems to be
A living nightmare, do you see?

So lock the doors and hide away
Pray that the horrors will not stray
For once they come, they are here to stay
In your home where nightmares lay.

Write a sad poem on home:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
A place once filled with laughter and joy  
Now sits empty, devoid of any ploy  
The walls that once held memories dear  
Now stand as silent witnesses of fear  

The floors that echoed with lively footsteps  
Now creak with a melancholic regret  
The windows that let in the warm sun  
Now seem to block out all the fun  

Furniture arranged with love and care  
Now lies scattered, as if in despair  
The curtains that swayed with the gentle breeze  
Now hang still, as if begging for release  

A home that was once filled with life  
Now echoes with a solemn strife  
The emptiness too heavy to bear  
As if it's waiting for someone to care  

The stillness now seems to haunt  
As if it's a message it wants to flaunt  
A home that once held our heart  
Now seems to be slowly falling apart  

Oh, how I wish to come back again  
To a place that was familiar, without any pain  
A home that once filled me with glee  
Now sits alone, as if waiting for me.

Write a happy poem on home:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Home, sweet home, my lovely den
A place that fills my heart with zen
Where I find peace and joy supreme
And every day is like a dream

The walls around, oh so divine
A world where nothing can malign
The memories of all the fun
We’ve had right here ‘til day is done

The warmth of love within these walls
Is a feeling that never stalls
A bond that strengthens every day
And fills our spirits with cherishing hay

Our hearts rejoice as we walk in
And leave behind the worldly din
For in this haven, life is good
And nothing else really can intrude

Our home, a place that we adore
For it’s the heart of all we’ve worked for
And as we revel in its bliss
We know we’re blessed with happiness

So sing with me, oh happy soul
For we’ve found the place to make us whole
A spot to cherish ‘til the end
Our home, our castle, our dear friend.

Write a angry poem on today:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Today, I feel the boiling rage
Swelling inside me, like a cage
Suppressing my soul, trapping my will
For today is a day that I must kill

The world around me seems to crumble
As I witness humanity stumble
Leaders and nations have failed to unite
Allowing darkness to take over the light

I see corruption, hate, and lies
The truth concealed by deceitful disguise
Injustice prevails in every land
Terrorism and war go hand in hand

How can we let this continue to be?
Why can’t we open our eyes and see?
The ignorance and apathy of mankind
Is destroying the world we once defined

I’m angry at the state of our today
But I refuse to be silenced, come what may
It’s time to stand up and take a stand
And heal the wounds of our broken land.

Write a scary poem on today:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Today is a day of terror,
A nightmare come to life.
For darkness reigns with fervor,
And fear cuts through like a knife.

The streets are empty, silent,
A ghost town in the grip of fear.
No sound but wind and violence,
As nightmares draw ever near.

The sun has vanished entirely,
Replaced by shadows deep and dark.
And all around there's snarling,
As demons prowl through parks.

The air is thick with whispers,
Whispers of the worst kind.
And in the midst of this horror,
You know you'll never be free to find.

Write a sad poem on today:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Today is heavy, laden with sorrow
A day of tears, a day to borrow
From yesterday's joys, now far away
Today's struggles, here to stay.

The sun still rises, but I am cold
A somber mood I cannot withhold
My heart aches, my eyes burn with tears
As I face today's daunting fears.

The world is filled with endless pain
A vicious cycle, over and again
Injustice, loss, and endless strife
Dimming the light that once gave life.

Today I mourn, for what was lost
For things that could not bear the cost
Of this tumultuous world we face
Where sadness takes a rightful place.

Today is sad, and so am I
For all the things that cannot die
For love that's lost, for dreams that fade
For every heart that's left unaided.

But even in this sadness, I will strive
And find hope to keep my spirit alive
And in the darkness that surrounds today
I'll find strength to make a better way.

Write a happy poem on today:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
The sun is shining bright,
The birds are singing with delight,
The air is crisp and clean,
Today is a day that's serene.

The flowers are in bloom,
Their beauty fills the room,
The world is full of color,
It's a day like no other.

The sky is a shade of blue,
So beautiful and true,
The sun's rays warm the skin,
It's a day to take it all in.

The happiness is contagious,
It's simply outrageous,
To feel so good inside,
It's a day we cannot hide.

Today is a gift,
So precious and swift,
Let's cherish it with all our might,
And bask in its glorious sight.

Write a angry poem on night:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Night, oh night, you wretched thief
Stealing my peace, my precious sleep
With your dark tendrils and endless depth
You suffocate me, leaving me bereft

Your silence is loud, your presence imposing
Your stillness unnerving, my heart foreboding
You're a canvas of shadows, a playground of demons
A breeding ground of anxieties and reasons

You rob me of the light, you cloak me in fear
Your embrace is cold, your touch is severe
You bring out the worst in me, you reveal my flaws
You stir up my worries, you fuel my wars

You're a constant reminder of my mortality
A reminder that death is a reality
You strip me of my strength, my will, my power
You leave me helpless, every single hour

Oh night, how I despise you, how I loathe you
How I wish I could banish you, and start anew
But you'll always be here, lurking in the shadows
A curse on my life, a burden I can't let go

So go on, night, do your worst, continue your reign
Cause no matter how hard I fight, you'll always remain
The dominator of my soul, the ruler of my heart
The bearer of my pain, my eternal counterpart.

Write a scary poem on night:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
As the sun sets and darkness falls
The creatures of the night heed their calls
The wind whispers through the trees
And the moon casts eerie shadows on the leaves

Every sound seems louder, everything seems strange
The rustling of leaves is enough to make you feel deranged
The silence of the night is deafening
And the darkness becomes more threatening

Each step is taken with utmost care
For the unknown awaits you everywhere
The darkness that surrounds sets the scene
For the most terrifying scenarios that you've never seen

The night unleashes its worst fears
The stuff of nightmares becomes quite clear
The shadows take on a life of their own
And the darkness seems like a throne

The night is a time to be feared
For the terrors that it holds are truly weird
The imagination runs rampant and wild
And you find yourself helpless and feeling mild

So beware of the darkness my friend
For it is not something that you can pretend
It will take hold of you and never let go
And the terror that it brings, you'll soon know.

Write a sad poem on night:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Oh, night how do you bear
The burden of so many tears
The agony of heartbreak and pain
That seeps into the dark, like a stain

In the quiet of your embrace
I hear the echoes of a lost race
The whispers of a thousand souls
As sorrow around us rolls

In the inky blackness of the sky
I see the tears of all who cry
For love that's gone, or dreams that die
For pain that stubbornly refuses to fly

Oh, night, your cloak is heavy
With the weight of misery
Like a shroud that covers all
As we weep in silence through the halls

But light will come with the dawn
Though for now, we must bear on
Through the dark embrace of night
Hoping that there will be light.

Write a happy poem on night:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
A peaceful night, all calm and still  
The moon shines bright above the hill  
The stars twinkle in the sky so high  
A sight that always makes me sigh  

The night brings with it a sense of peace  
A moment where all worries cease  
A time to reflect and just be  
A moment to set my spirit free  

The cool breeze whispers in my ear  
A lovely sound that I want to hear  
It brings me joy, it brings me glee  
A moment that makes me truly happy  

The night is a canvas of wonder and delight  
A time to soak in the beauty of starlight  
It's a moment that fills me with glee  
A moment that's happy, just like me!  

So let's cherish the night, let's celebrate its charm  
Let's immerse ourselves in its soothing balm  
For this moment is precious, this moment is sweet  
A moment that cannot be beat!

Write a angry poem on eyes:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Oh eyes, how you deceive me so
All those lies you make me endure
I trusted you to show me the truth
But instead, you chose to obscure

You dared to look away from my pain
And never once showed any remorse
Your loyalty lies with the darkness
Leaving me alone to face life's force

Why must you play with my emotions
And bring me down to my very knees
You hold the power to hurt and destroy
And yet you act as if you do not see

From now on, I vow to shut you out
And never again give you control
For your treacherous ways have caused enough pain
And I refuse to play this game any more.

Write a scary poem on eyes:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Within the deep abyss of night,
A haunting specter's eerie sight.
Two orbs stare, unperturbed and still,
Infinite voids that seem to thrill.

Beware the eyes that watch from afar,
Their visage lurking, casting a vile star.
A mesmerizing glance that draws you near,
A sinister trap that instills fear.

Once you glance into those eyes,
You'll find no escape; you'll hear no cries.
A blackness swallows all you know,
A soulless void that swallows you whole.

Keep your distance, save yourselves,
For eyes can cast some chilling spells.
In the darkness, they observe,
And seek to feast on all they serve.

So if the eyes appear to you,
Run fast, run far, whatever you do,
For if you are caught, you'll be ensnared,
Trapped in a horror beyond compare.

Write a sad poem on eyes:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
With every tear that falls from them,
The eyes seem haunted, lost in thought.
In gloomy silence, they stare ahead,
As if trying to grapple with the world's onslaught.

The sparkle that once shone so bright,
Faded as darkness crept in slow.
With every blink, they seem to sigh,
Holding secrets that no one knows.

These eyes, once full of life and joy,
Now reflect the pain inside the soul.
Their gaze, now cold and numb,
Leaves one feeling incomplete and whole.

The tears that fall down their cheeks,
Are a silent plea for some relief.
For the burden that these eyes now bear,
Is too heavy for them to bear alone in grief.

If only someone could read their gaze,
Uncloak the secrets behind their folds.
Maybe then these eyes will once again,
Shine bright like stars in skies untold.

Write a happy poem on eyes:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Oh, eyes so bright and blue,
How I simply adore you!
With each gaze and every blink,
My heart begins to dance and sing.

You are the windows to the soul,
Guiding us towards our ultimate goal.
Filled with love and joy and bliss,
Your beauty is impossible to miss.

The way you twinkle and shine,
Makes my heart feel oh so fine.
You bring a light into my day,
And make everything seem okay.

Oh, eyes so full of life and light,
I cherish you with all my might.
May you continue to bring us cheer,
And always stay bright and clear.

So here's to you, dear eyes so true,
Thank you for all that you do.
You make the world a brighter place,
And fill our souls with endless grace.

Write a angry poem on  lips:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Lips, oh you deceivers, 
How dare you play your cruel game?
With your promising curves and flirtatious pouts, 
You lure the innocent to shame. 

You whisper sweet nothings to each ear, 
And let loose words of poison with a sneer. 
You pass on kisses like tainted drops, 
And yet, with venom, you never stop. 

You break hearts with a mere sound, 
And you revel in the misery that you've found. 
You smile and grin as love fades away, 
And still, you have nothing to say. 

Lips, you are not a comforting friend, 
But a bitter enemy until the very end. 
You leave behind the destruction you've sewn, 
And never face the consequences fully known. 

I curse you, lips, and pray you one day pay, 
For the pain and resentment you spread each day. 
May your days be filled with guilt and regret, 
For the wounds and scars that you can't forget.

Write a scary poem on  lips:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Beware the lips that curl with glee
In shadows lurking, you might not see
Those crimson curves that beckon close
Can lead to danger most morose

Their whispers stir a sense of dread
As if from ancient tombs long dead
And yet you move in closer still
Drawn in by a forbidden thrill

But heed this warning, and take care
For those lips harbor dark despair
And what you seek may cost you all
Be wary of their siren call

For once they touch, they may not free
Your soul from their captivity
And so I warn, my friend, take pause
Lest lips of horror be your cause.

Write a sad poem on  lips:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Once full of life and laughter
Now they're silent as they beg for water
Chapped and cracked from lack of care
My lips, once beautiful, now declare

The sadness of my heart's despair
As they part, they seem to wear
A frown that lingers in the air
A reflection of the pain I bear

They whisper secrets I dare not share
As they tremble in the cold winter air
Longing for a kiss, a touch so rare
But all they find is emptiness, a love affair

My lips, now pale and thin,
A symbol of the life I've been
Lonely, lost, and filled with sin,
A tragic end to where I've been.

Write a happy poem on  lips:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Lips so smooth and red,
A perfect pout, no need to be fed,
A smile so wide, an expression so pure,
With lips like these, life is always a cure.

They bring me joy, they bring me bliss,
With every kiss, I feel like I'm in the midst,
Of something magical, a moment divine,
These lips of mine, they always shine.

They speak words of love, words of affection,
They're full of life, never dull or in dejection,
With every laugh, every grin,
These lips bring happiness, from deep within.

So here's to lips, those precious things,
Without them, life would have no wings,
I'm grateful for the way they make me feel,
These lips of mine, forever real.

Write a angry poem on face:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Oh face, so useless and vain
You bring nothing but constant pain
With every pore and every line
You mock me, and waste my precious time

Your blemishes and imperfections
Are a blight upon my complexion
No matter how much I primp and preen
You refuse to be what I want you to be

Daily I must face your wrath
Your redness, your oil, your stubborn path
You mock my efforts to erase
Your unwelcome presence on my face

I wish I could simply cast you aside
To have a clear and blemish-free hide
But alas, you are with me to stay
Forever mocking me day by day

So I curse you, face, with every breath
That you may suffer a slow and painful death
But until that day, I'll face the strife
Of dealing with you all my life.

Write a scary poem on face:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
The face that stares at me,
In the darkness of the night,
With eyes that glow with hellish fire,
And skin as pale as moonlight.

Its lips are twisted into a grin,
Both cold and full of spite,
As though it hungers for my fear,
And relishes my fright.

The nose is sharp and pointed,
Like the beak of a bird of prey,
And the creaking of its bones,
Makes my blood run cold in dismay.

It seems to leer at me,
With a sense of ancient dread,
And I know that I am trapped,
In its unyielding grip of dread.

My heart beats fast and hard,
As I pray for morning light,
For I know that I am facing,
A demon in human guise.

Write a sad poem on face:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
A face so soft, so perfect, so bright,
Now clouded by tears, so dimmed by night.
The grace that once shone from within,
Now flees the pain, the hurt, the sin.

The skin that held a smile so wide,
Now crumples and sags, with sadness inside.
The eyes that once sparkled with joy,
Now dull with sorrow, like a broken toy.

The lips that spoke of love and hope,
Now quiver with grief, you can hardly cope.
The cheeks that once turned rosy red,
Now dry and pale, like they’re already dead.

It’s the face that tells a tale so true,
Of a heart that was shattered, a soul so blue.
It’s the face that longs for love and rest,
But the pain lingers on, it just won’t regress.

So let us pause for this face so sad,
And offer our comfort and love to add.
For with a little bit of kindness and care,
This face of sadness can be transformed to be fair.

Write a happy poem on face:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Oh, the beauty of a smile
It brightens up the room
It makes our hearts skip a beat
And dissipates all gloom

The laughter in your eyes
And the joy on your face
Are precious gifts we cherish
In every time and place

From dimples to sparkling teeth
Your face is a work of art
It fills us with delight
And touches every heart

No matter where you go
Or wherever you roam
Your face is a beacon of hope
A shining light of home

So let us celebrate
The radiance of your face
And all the happiness it brings
To every heart and place

Write a angry poem on hair:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Oh, how I hate my hair,
It's like an uncontrollable flare,
A wild beast that refuses to be tamed,
Constantly leaving me ashamed.

It's frizzy, dull and full of knots,
A mess that no amount of product can spot,
I try to style it to no avail,
A constant struggle that leaves me pale.

It defies my every command,
A frustrating thing that I can't stand,
It's like it has a mind of its own,
A rogue entity that leaves me alone.

I envy those with luscious locks,
Those who don't have to deal with this angry box,
They can just wake up and go,
While I struggle with this foe.

I long for a day when it will submit,
Obey me and do as it's meant,
But until then, I'll continue to swear,
In frustration at my unruly hair.

Write a scary poem on hair:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tangles of hair, black as pitch,
Creeping and crawling, inch by inch.
Whispers in the night, voices unknown,
Dread and fear, all alone.

Tripping over strands, twisted and vile,
A chilling feeling, an eerie smile.
Dead eyes stare, from the void of hair,
Reaching out, with a choking snare.

Horrors within, twisted and gnarled,
A mane of darkness, never tamed or scarred.
Run if you can, but it'll follow you still,
Inescapable, an unearthly thrill.

Don't let it grab you, or encase your head,
Be warned, beware, or wind up dead.
For in the depths of this living snare,
Lurks a monster that knows no care.

So be mindful of your locks, and keep them maintained,
For if you don't, fear will be unchained.
A nightmare born of hair, will take your soul,
And leave behind, an empty hole.

Write a sad poem on hair:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Once thick and luscious,
now thin and frail.
Fading away, oh so fast,
my crowning glory turns pale.

Once cascading like a waterfall,
now mere strands left on my head.
I search for the lost beauty,
but all hope seems to have fled.

It's a reminder of my age,
my body slowly decays.
No more vibrant and strong,
just weak and easily swayed.

I grieve a loss so profound,
the mane I once wore with pride.
Now just remnants of what was,
a reminder of time's cruel ride.

Oh, how I miss those strands,
that made me feel complete.
Now, all that's left is emptiness,
as hair falls at my feet.

Write a happy poem on hair:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Oh, how lovely and wild
Is the hair that crowns our head
It shines and bounces in the sun
Or cascades down in a wave so fun!

Soft as a kitten, curly or straight
To cut it short or let it wait
It frames our face and adds some charm
And we can style it in so many forms!

From a messy bun to a braided plait
We can play around and feel great
A new layer of confidence we gain
With every hair flip and wave of our mane!

Let's celebrate this beautiful crown
That makes us feel special all around
Let's twirl and dance and laugh with glee
For our hair, oh yes, it makes us happy!

Write a angry poem on wrist:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Oh wrist, you wretched thing  
So weak and so prone to break  
Always causing me such pain  
When all I want is a steady hand to make  

You sabotage my every move  
With your constant aches and stings  
Making it hard for me to groove  
And perform even simple things  

When I try to lift, you give out  
When I try to write, you quiver  
You're always causing me doubt  
Making my movements ever so shiver  

Why must you be so fragile  
When all I need is a sturdy limb  
You make life such a hassle  
And leave me feeling rather grim  

So wrist, know this:  
I'm angry and I'm fed up with your ways  
I'll heal you up and give you a kiss  
But don't ever mess with me for days

Write a scary poem on wrist:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
A sudden chill, I cannot deny
Takes hold of me, as I look nigh
At the wrist, adorned with ink and chain
It sends shivers down my spine again

What secrets lurk beneath the skin?
What horrors lie within?
The wrist, it holds a tale untold 
A story that will make your blood run cold

Beneath the veins, a darkness hides
Creeping slowly, like a parasite 
It spreads its fear, it feeds its need
It lingers there, to make you bleed

Beware the wrist, for it holds power
A force that grows by the hour 
It beckons for your soul to thrive 
A tempting call, that few survive 

So be careful, when you gaze upon 
The wrist that you thought was so benign 
For in its depths, there lies a fright
A fear that can consume you in the night.

Write a sad poem on wrist:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
With each stroke of the blade,
I felt a release like no other.
My wrist became my canvas,
And the world my eager observer.

But with each cut, I bled,
My pain and sorrows unclenched.
The red seeping into the white,
Tainted with tears and regrets.

My wrist now bears the scars,
Of all the moments I couldn't bear.
A lifelong reminder,
Of the pain I couldn't spare.

Now as I look at my wrist,
I see the damage I've wrought.
A regretful tale etched in flesh,
Of battles I've lost and fought.

Though the wounds may heal,
The memories they can't erase.
A sorrowful poem on my wrist,
A haunting reminder of my mistakes.

Write a happy poem on wrist:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Oh, wrist, so slender and so fine,
You always seem to just be mine.
You carry me through every day,
And never complain or fade away.

Without you, I'm sure I'd be lost,
My life would have a heavy cost.
But with you here, I'm able to write,
To paint, to play, to dance all night.

So let us raise a joyful toast,
To our wrists, we love you the most.
You brighten up our every day,
And we'll never let you fade away.

Write a angry poem on cheek:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Oh, cheek so smug and round and firm,  
You think you're cute, but you make me squirm.  
Always so prominent in every face,  
Demanding attention in every space. 

You have the audacity to blush  
As if you've done nothing to make me hush.  
But oh, cheek, I'm on to you -  
I know the games you like to do. 

You twitch and jiggle at the sight of anger,  
As if you're daring me to be a stranger  
To my own thoughts and feelings deep,  
While you remain aloof, sound asleep. 

Your rosy glow mocks my rage,  
As if you're on some high pedestal stage.  
But I won't bow to your tyrannical sway,  
I'll stand up to you and have my say. 

So cheek, listen up, and listen well,  
I won't be silenced by your intimidating shell.  
You may be just a small part of my face,  
But I'll make sure to put you in your place.

Write a scary poem on cheek:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Beneath the flesh and bone,  
Lies a horror all its own.  
A malignant force that creeps and crawls,  
Silent stalker, awaiting your call.  

The cheek may seem unassuming,  
A simple part of your being,  
But within its confines, a terror lurks,  
A dread that will make you berserk.  

It whispers secrets you don't want to hear,  
That will fill you with terror, with dread and with fear.  
It's the creature within that you cannot control,  
A monster that lurches, that feeds on your soul.  

Don't look too closely, don't peer too near,  
Or hear the whispers, the whispers of fear.  
For the cheek is a place you do not dare,  
To wander within, unless you seek despair.

Write a sad poem on cheek:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
The cheek once bright, now dull and pale  
A lover's touch no more prevails  
The tears that fall upon its skin  
Are testaments of what has been  

Once kissed by lips that loved so true  
A feeling that was pure and new  
Now alone in sorrow it lies  
A forgotten place where pain resides  

Memories of laughter and joy  
A child's giggle, a lover's coy  
All fading fast as time goes by  
Leaving only a mournful sigh  

The cheek that once held hope and light  
Is now a shadow of its might  
For in this world of love and loss  
It pays the ultimate cost  

Yet it bears the weight of all our tears  
For every pain and every fear  
The cheek remains steadfast and true  
A symbol of what once was new.

Write a happy poem on cheek:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Oh, the joy that my cheek brings to me
A rosy hue that's oh so lovely to see
It lifts my spirits up high
And makes me feel like I can touch the sky

I love the feel of a warm hand on my cheek
So gentle and tender, it makes me weak
My cheeks serve as my smile's best friend
And bring happiness to the very end

With every little giggle and laugh
My cheeks glow bright like a starry night sky
And with every kiss I receive and give
My cheeks are so happy, they could just fly

It's hard not to smile when my cheeks are so bright
They bring happiness and delight
So here's to my cheeks, my little bits of joy
May they always bring happiness to this girl and boy.

Write a angry poem on rose:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Furious petals, thorns that prick
A vicious beauty, sickly slick
You flaunt your hues, your sickening grace
I see straight through your mask, your counterfeit face

You claim to offer love and care
But deep down you're a thorny snare
A poison bloom, with no good intent
You cause pain and misery, with no relent

Your beauty fades, but your venom stays
Your poisoned scent, a toxic craze
I loathe your kind, your deceitful guise
I'll never be fooled by your rose-colored lies

So take your thorns, your petals red
Your treacherous poise, your lies unsaid
I'll have none of it, no matter the price
Your rose can perish, I'll take the ice.

Write a scary poem on rose:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
In a garden bloomed a rose so fair,
But its beauty hid dark secrets there.
Its petals blood red, its thorns so sharp,
And under moonlight, it seemed to harp.

Beneath its bloom, a curse did grow,
A haunting tale of woe and woe.
For every bloom that graced its stem,
A soul was taken without reprieve or rem.

Its thorns were like the devil's claws,
Sharpened only to prolong its cause.
It crept upon its prey in silence,
And drank its life with no defiance.

The rose was once a lovely thing,
But now it's been cursed to only bring,
Pain, horror, and dreadful fate,
For every soul who dares to wait.

So beware the rose that blooms so fair,
For its beauty is a devil's snare.
It is not love it does impart,
But a frightening death, so beware its heart!

Write a sad poem on rose:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
The rose once bright and bold
Now droops with heavy weight
Each petal wilted, tired, and old
Its beauty fades, deteriorates

Once a symbol of love and passion
Now a symbol of loss and pain
The once vibrant red, now ashen
A stunning flower, now in vain

The rose is but a fleeting thing
A reminder that nothing lasts
Its beauty fades with time's ticking wing
Until it's but a memory of the past

I mourn the rose's fleeting beauty
As it fades, it breaks my heart
I'll remember it as it once was truly
A symbol of love, a work of art.

Write a happy poem on rose:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Oh, rose of beauty and delight,
Your petals soft, your color bright.
You bring us joy and happiness,
And fill our hearts with tenderness.

With every petal that unfolds,
You speak of love, that never grows old.
Your fragrance sweet, we cannot deny,
Fills our senses, and takes us high.

Oh, rose of wonder, soft and pure,
A symbol of love that will forever endure.
You bring a smile to every face,
A sweet reminder of love and grace.

So let us cherish you, oh rose divine,
A precious gift that nature did design.
May your beauty flourish forevermore,
And bring us joy that we adore.

Write a angry poem on jasmine:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Oh jasmine, you wretched flower,
Your scent, how it wreaks such power.
A cloying, sickly, sweet perfume,
That makes my head want to boom.

You're everywhere, in every yard,
In every vase, in every card.
You steal attention, hog the stage,
And turn my stomach in a rage.

Your delicate petals, so white,
Deceive us all with your toxic might.
For every breath we take of thee,
Brings us closer to agony.

Oh jasmine, you may look divine,
But in truth, you're a thief and a swine.
You steal our air, pollute the night,
And fill us all with venomous blight.

So take heed, my fellow man,
And banish jasmine from our land.
For every plant that we uproot,
Prevents a hundred more from taking root.

Write a scary poem on jasmine:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Jasmine, oh sweet jasmine,
A scent so lovely and divine,
But within its blooms lies a terror,
A horror that can make you quiver.

Beneath the petals, in the shadows,
Lurks a spirit, dark and hollow,
It seeks the scent, it craves the beauty,
And it will stop at nothing to fulfill its duty.

With long, twisted fangs it bites,
Injecting venom that burns and blights,
The sweet fragrance turns to ash,
And in its place, a deadly gas.

As the vapor fills your lungs,
Your heart beats faster, your vision stuns,
The world around you fades to black,
And you're left alone with the jasmine's attack.

So beware, oh brave adventurer,
Do not be tempted by jasmine's splendor,
For within its blooms lies a terror,
A horror that can make you quiver.

Write a sad poem on jasmine:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Jasmine, once a symbol of love
Now only reminds me of loss
Its blooming flowers, so pure and white
Seem to mock me in their light

For I once had a love like jasmine
Pure, beautiful and full of grace
But like the flower's fleeting fragrance
It slipped away, leaving an empty space

Now I walk past jasmine bushes
And feel the ache in my heart
A reminder of a love that was once
But now has been torn apart

Oh, jasmine, your sweet scent
Is now a painful reminder
Of a love that faded away
Leaving nothing but a void inside her.

Write a happy poem on jasmine:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Jasmine, oh jasmine, how sweet and pure
Your fragrance is a joy that will always endure
With petals soft and white, you bloom
A lovely sight, in the morning light's room

Your scent, it lingers on the breeze
A soft caress, that puts the mind at ease
You evoke feelings of love and glee
A symbol, of hope and tranquility

In every garden, you bring delight
A celebration of life, in hues so bright
The world is filled with your beauty
A natural wonder, that's our duty

So let us take a moment and appreciate
The jasmine in our lives, and its loving fate
For every time we breathe in the sweet scent
Our hearts lighten up, and our souls are content.

Write a angry poem on lotus:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Oh cursed lotus, with treacherous bloom
Your delicate petals, a devious tomb
Your beauty betrays, and deceives the mind
A serpent coiled, with venom to grind

Your fragrance so sweet, yet sickly and sour
The scent of a wicked, deceitful power
Your tranquil waters, a murky abyss
A place for deceit, and venomous hiss

Your leaves so pure, yet tainted with lies
A cover of innocence, a cloak of disguise
Your roots so deep, entangle the soul
A trap for the weak, a deadly black hole

Oh cursed lotus, with treacherous bloom
May your deceitful beauty meet its doom
May your wickedness wither, and be no more
An end to your venomous, deceiving lore.

Write a scary poem on lotus:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
In the stillness of the pond so deep,
A lone lotus flower did peacefully sleep,
Its petals pale in the moonlight's glow,
A beauty and a mystery to behold.

But do not be fooled by its sweet scent,
For the lotus has a dark intent,
A siren's call to those who dare,
To venture close and linger there.

Its leaves will wrap and suffocate,
A deadly trap that seals your fate,
And as you struggle to break free,
The lotus feasts upon your misery.

Its roots run deep, a twisted maze,
That pulls you down into its embrace,
And as you sink into the mire,
The lotus smirks with dark desire.

So if you find a lotus in your way,
Beware its beauty and don't delay,
For if you linger for too long,
You'll join the countless souls it's claimed in song.

Write a sad poem on lotus:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
In waters still, where silence reigns
A lotus blooms, its petals pale
A flower fragile to the pains
Of life, in death it will exhale

Each day, it faces the sun
Its beauty shining bright and bold
But when the darkness has begun
Its beauty fades, its heart grows cold

For in this world of fleeting love
The lotus finds no place to thrive
It bows its head to skies above
And in its sorrow, starts to wither and die

Oh lotus, woe be unto thee
A flower born to suffer so
That in your death, you offer free
A timeless beauty to our woe.

Write a happy poem on lotus:
-------------------------------------------------------------- 
Lotus flowers so fair and bright,
Their beauty shines in the light,
With petals soft and colors bold,
They inspire stories yet untold.

Amidst the water they doth rise,
A sight that makes our hearts surprise,
A symbol of hope, rebirth and grace,
Lotus blossoms in every place.

Their fragrance lingers in the air,
And sparkles joy in ev’rywhere,
A gift from nature, pure and kind,
Bringing happiness to all mankind.

May we always cherish the lotus,
A symbol of love and hope amongst us,
And remember the wonders it brings,
As we dance and sing with happy wings.

Her roots deep down in mud and clay,
She rises tall above the waves,
Her beauty cast in bright array,
Her spirit free from worldly graves.

The lotus blooms with perfect charm,
A sight to soothe a restless mind,
She casts a spell upon all harm,
And leaves our weary souls refined.

Amidst the calm waters,
Stands a beauty rare.
With petals unfurled,
Lotus sits in glory and care.

The sun kisses its skin,
And the dew drops dance.
Amidst the greenery and din,
Lotus flaunts its elegance and romance.

That leaves us in awe, forever bowed.

Oh, Lotus, you are a sight to behold,
A magnificent work of art, untold.

The lotus blooms in muddy ponds,
Its beauty knows no bounds,
Its petals soft and pink, so rare,
A symbol of grace beyond compare.

In stillness, it begins to thrive,
Its radiance taking over the dive,
A reminder of hope in murky times,
A sign of strength amidst life's chimes.

The lotus teaches us to stay strong,
To rise above the muck and carry on,
For like the lotus, we too can shine,
And conquer storms with grace divine.
