-------------------------------------------------------------- 
In the heart of the forest green,
Roamed a mighty lion king.
His mane was ablaze with gold,
His roar thundered bold.

The trees would shiver and cower,
As he prowled with dominion and power.
All creatures would flee his sight,
For they feared his presence in the night.

But deep in the woods, there was solace,
A peaceful haven from his approach.
The lion's savage ways were halted,
By the calmness of the forest that vaulted.

For in this haven, he was tamed,
By the serenity that the forest claimed.
No longer a ferocious king,
He learned to relish the peace it can bring.
